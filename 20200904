5:45 AM Woke up and started working. I need to complete a lot of articles today.

6:02 AM Backlinks has been added to notion.so

I like how clean the nuclino looks. But for some reason chrome is not showing the icons. 

It looks like nuclino has a desktop app but I am not sure if it can work offline.

6:34 AM Linked my back up google sheet to Nuclino. It works, but I wish the page is larger. 

7:03 AM Helped father fixing the water pipes again. 

8:53 AM Finished thirty articles. Not bad and I still have time left to update my production for yesterday

8:58 AM Tried using Cerveau.
